During this pandemic, I’ve tried to rekindle a habit of consistently reading for an hour a day. Over the years, I accumulated a large stack of books to get through, and a tiny but consistent nagging in my mind finally pushed me to commit to a schedule. Not only is this post an outlet to share what I’ve been reading and what I found fascinating, it’s also an accountability tactic. I’ll update this post as I keep on reading, so I’m failing if there are no recent edits.
